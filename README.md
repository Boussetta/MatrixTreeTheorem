# Matrix-Tree Theorem [Kirchhoff's theorem]

The Matrix-Tree Theorem is a formula for the number of spanning trees of a graph in terms of the determinant of a certain matrix.

Kirchhoff's theorem relies on the notion of the Laplacian matrix of a graph that is equal to the difference between the graph's degree matrix (a diagonal matrix with vertex degrees on the diagonals) and its adjacency matrix (a (0,1)-matrix with 1's at places corresponding to entries where the vertices are adjacent and 0's otherwise).
